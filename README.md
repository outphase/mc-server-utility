# Minecraft Server Setup Utility

This is a simple utility to help you setup a Minecraft server. 
To use this optimally, I reccomend adding it to your `Path`;

Note that this will automatically agree to [Minecraft's EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).

## Usage

1. Download a `server.jar` file from [Minecraft's official website](https://www.minecraft.net/ee-us/ownload/server) and place it in an empty directory. 

    - _Optional_ Choose an image to have as your server icon, name it `icon.png` and place it in the same directory. It is best if this icon is square, so the program does not stretch it to fit the required dimensions.

2. Run the application in one of the following ways:
    - a. Add `mc-server-utility.exe` to your `PATH` variable. Run `mc-server-utility.exe` with your terminal in the directory you created above.
    - b. Copy `mc-server-utility.exe` to the directory created above. Run `mc-server-utility.exe` (less reccomended).

3. Follow the instructions given by the application.

4. To run your server after step 4, you will have to run the `start-server.bat` file, it is reccomended to create a shortcut to that file where it's conveniently accessible. The program will even provide a `.ico` file to set as the shortcut's icon if you provide an image in the step above!

5. Enjoy playing Minecraft with your friends! 

> [!NOTE]
> You or your friends may experience issues connecting to the server. 
> This application does not do anything to forward the necessary ports, 
> install the correct JRE version, etc. 
> I reccomend looking up resources related to these problems 
> as well as checking your firewall settings if you encounter any issues. 
> Beyond this, I will not provide support on this front.
> I will only respond to issues if related to `mc-server-utility` in particular
