# Minecraft Server Setup Utility

This is a simple utility to help you setup a Minecraft server. 
To use this optimally, I reccomend adding it to your `Path`;

Note that this will automatically agree to [Minecraft's EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).

## Usage

1. Download a `server.jar` file from [Minecraft's official website](https://www.minecraft.net/ee-us/ownload/server) and place it in an empty directory. 

    1.1. _Optional_ Choose an image to have as your server icon, name it `icon.png` and place it in the same directory. It is best if this icon is square, so the program does not stretch it to fit the required dimensions.

2.a.1. Add `mc-server-utility.exe` to your `PATH` variable.

    2.a.1 Run `mc-server-utility.exe` with your terminal in the directory you created above.

2.b.1. Copy `mc-server-utility.exe` to the directory created above.

    2.b.2. Run `mc-server-utility.exe`.

4. Follow the instructions given by the application.

5. To un your server after step 4, you will have to run the `start-server.bat` file, it is reccomended to create a shortcut to that file where it's conveniently accessible. The program will even provide a `.ico` file to set as the shortcut's icon if you provide an image in the step above!

6. Enjoy playing Minecraft with your friends! 

> [!NOTE]
> You or your friends may experience issues connecting to the server. 
> This application does not do anything to forward the necessary ports, 
> install the correct JRE version, etc. 
> I reccomend looking up resources related to these problems 
> as well as checking your firewall settings if you encounter any issues. 
> Beyond this, I will not provide support on this front.
> I will only respond to issues if related to my mc-server-utility in particular
