# Minecraft Server Setup Utility

This is a simple utility to help you setup a Minecraft server. Just download the `server.jar` file from [minecraft's official website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) and place it in an empty directory. If you wish to add an icon, place any `.png` in the same directory and just run the program.
